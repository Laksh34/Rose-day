        There are a lot of things that the flower rose signifies. It signifies beauty, it signifies change, but most
        importantly, it signifies how love and sacrifice are intertwined. For one to love and be loved, some sacrifices
        are necessary, and it takes a lot of heart for one to love someone. Here is my rose of love to you, and I hope
        you see the emotions with which I give it to you. I think I have finally managed to make my heart strong enough
        to love you.
